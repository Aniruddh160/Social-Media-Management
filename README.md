# Social-Media-Management

# Project Overview
This project is a backend implementation for a social media management system built using FastAPI and PostgreSQL. It includes functionality for user authentication, image storage, and managing social media posts. The project also uses SQLAlchemy for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and Alembic for database migrations.

# Features
User Authentication: Secure user login and registration using OAuth2 with password hashing.
Post Management: Allows users to create, read, update, and delete social media posts.
Image Storage: Efficiently stores images as large binaries in the database.
Followers Management: Keeps track of user followers and their counts.
